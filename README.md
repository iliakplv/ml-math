# ml-math

This is **not** a Machine Learning framework. 

This is an implementation of fundamental mathematics of ML (specifically, Neural Networks) just for fun.

## Run

`$ python main.py`

## Contents

- `main.py` - training experiment: architecture and hyperparameters
- `activation.py` - activation functions and their derivatives
- `algebra.py` - vector and matrix operations
- `data.csv` - Iris dataset for training/evaluation
- `data.py` - data loading, shuffling, normalisation
- `metrics.py` - evaluation metrics and loss functions
- `propagation.py` - backpropagation algorithm
- `train.py` - parameter initialisation and model training

## To-do (maybe)

- Train/evaluation data split
- Stochastic gradient descent
- More activation functions
- Softmax
- Regularisation
- Refactor all the things
- Optimise all the things
