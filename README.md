# ml-math

This is **not** a Machine Learning framework. 

This is an implementation of fundamental mathematics of ML (specifically, Neural Networks) just for fun.

### Contents

`activation.py` - activation functions such as [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) and [hyperbolic tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function)

`algebra.py` - vector and matrix operations

`metrics.py` - evaluation metrics such as [cross entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy)

### TODO

- Differentiation

- Gradient Descent algorithm

- Backpropagation algorithm

- Random initialisation (symmetry breaking)

- Training and evaluation

- Regularisation
