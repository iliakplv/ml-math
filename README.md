# ml-math

This is **not** a Machine Learning framework. 

This is an implementation of fundamental mathematics of ML (specifically, Neural Networks) just for fun.

## Run

`$ python main.py`

## To-do (maybe)

- Train/evaluation data split
- Stochastic gradient descent
- More activation functions
- Softmax
- Regularisation
- Refactor all the things
- Optimise all the things
